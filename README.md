### COVARIANCE ###
Covariance is a statistical tool that is used to determine the relationship between the movement of two asset prices.
When two stocks tend to move together, they are seen as having a positive covariance; when they move inversely, the covariance is negative.
FOR EXAMPLE: I want to buy some products and I don't know their are good or not so I found that data from google and see X and Y company growth rate during this and last year
Then I calculate X and Y company Mean
Then to see goodness find the diffrerence between each value and mean price.
Multiply the result of X and Y Difference
using that final number and find the COVARIANCE.
If the answer is POSITIVE so I notice that company X and Y are good to buy any product, And If the answer is negative Products are not good to buy.
### BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION ##########
The binomial distribution model allows us to compute the probability of observing a specified number of "successes" when the process is repeated a specific number of times (e.g., in a set of patients) and the outcome for a given patient is either a success or a failure.
IN Another Example: If I want to see in JUNK_FOOD_VS_HEALTHY_FOOD Project What type of JUNK_FOOD prefered by GENDER. IN THIS CASE MY DEPENDENT VARIABLE IS GENDER OR IS CATEGORICAL
VARIABLE AND OUR INDEPENDENT VARIABLE IS TYPE OF JUNK_FOOD. AND WE GOT SOME DATA THAT HOW MUCH LIKE JUNK_FOOD GENDER ARE.
